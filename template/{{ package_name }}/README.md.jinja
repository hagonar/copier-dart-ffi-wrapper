# {{ package_name }}

{{ description }}

## Features

- Cross-platform support: Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows
- Automatic native library download via build hooks
- SHA256 checksum verification for supply chain security
- Pure Dart FFI implementation (no platform channels)

## Installation

Add `{{ package_name }}` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  {{ package_name }}: ^x.x.x
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

The native libraries will be downloaded automatically during the build process.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:{{ package_name }}/{{ package_name }}.dart';

void main() {
  // TODO: Add usage example
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) ({{ flutter_sdk_version }})
- [FVM](https://fvm.app/) (recommended for version management)
- Make (for build commands)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/{{ github_repo }}.git
cd {{ package_name }}

# Setup development environment
make setup

# Run tests
make test

# See all available commands
make help
```

### Building Native Libraries

Native libraries are pre-built and downloaded automatically via build hooks.
If you need to build them locally:

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build ARGS="<platform>"

# Examples:
make build ARGS="macos --arch arm64"
make build ARGS="linux --arch x86_64"
make build ARGS="android --abi arm64-v8a"
```

### Regenerating FFI Bindings

After modifying header files:

```bash
make regen
```
